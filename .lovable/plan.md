# Project Solar – Lead Generation Landing Page

## Overview
A high-converting, single-page landing page for Project Solar UK, designed to drive booked home appointments for solar + battery storage surveys. Clean, premium design inspired by Funding Fred's layout — predominantly white with Project Solar's green (#00897B-ish) as the accent colour. Mobile-first, fast-loading, and focused on reducing friction for qualified leads.

## Page Sections (Top to Bottom)

- Stays visible throughout the page to maximise conversion

### 3. Expandable "Why Choose Us" Section
